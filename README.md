KNOW YOUR SELF Platform 🩺

Live Demo: https://are-you-fit-cac45.web.app/

📝 Project Overview

A comprehensive web app where users upload body images for immediate AI analysis and structured health data reports.

HealthAI leverages the power of Artificial Intelligence to bridge the gap between users and medical insights. By allowing users to post images of health concerns (like skin issues or injuries), the system performs a multimodal analysis to provide instant, data-driven diagnostic suggestions and health management tools.

🚀 Key Features

AI Vision Diagnostics: Users can upload images and describe symptoms for real-time analysis using Google Gemini’s multimodal capabilities.

Interactive Symptom Checker: A structured tool where users select symptoms to receive a list of likely conditions and medical recommendations.

Pediatric Health Dashboard: Specialized tracking for children, including age-based growth charts, vaccination schedules, and nutritional guidelines.

Persistent Health History: Every analysis is securely saved to a private user history, allowing for long-term health tracking.

Disease Library: A searchable database of over 200+ common diseases with details on causes, risks, and treatments.

Secure Document Vault: Upload and manage medical reports (PDFs) securely in the cloud.
